University of Virginia B.A. Statistics Capstone project exploring how the growth of passive investment management has affected the volatility of individual stock prices in the U.S stock market.

This repository tracks our progress through the capstone.

## Question of Interest

Do stocks that experienced relatively larger increases in passive ownership after 2010 also experience larger increases in return volatility, measured using daily and annual volatility, relative to stocks with smaller increases in passive ownership?

*Important context: virtually every stock with a sizable ($1bn+) market capitalization has had an increase in passive ownership over time. So, to perform our analysis, **we will be comparing stocks with the highest amount increase in passive ownership with those who have had the lowest increase in passive ownership** (regardless of the latter group most likely having had an absolute increase in the % of float owned by passive managers like the former) from our basket of stocks (S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, or CRSP Index).*
